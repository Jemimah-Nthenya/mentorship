        <h4>Chapter 1 and 2</h4>
        <p>"Born a Crime" by Trevor Noah is a book talking about the complexities of race, identity, and upbringing in apartheid South Africa. In chapter one and two, Noah  recalls his childhood experiences growing up as a mixed-race child in a society where it seemed illegal. Through humor and courage, Travor overcomes the challenges of not belonging to neither the black nor the white communities.This gave him the title “Born a crime”.<br><br>
            The two chapters provide a precise insight into the unfavorable  realities of apartheid and the lasting effects on South African society. Trevor speaks of his relationship with his mother, Patricia, how she goes against the laws by deciding to conceive him, this shows the strength and resilience and a love of a mother in the diverse society. Trevor speaks about his experiences navigating the racial dynamics of South Africa which shed light on the general discrimination and systemic oppression that characterized the apartheid era.<br><br>
            Trevor’s experience in a society full of discrimination, racism and much more, the issues he addresses relates with Kenya and its history of colonialism and ethnic tensions.Just as  South Africa, Kenya has battled with the legacy of colonialism, which left lasting scars on its social fabric. The themes of racism, identity and belonging that Trevor explores are universal and apply to any society in the world where people are categorized based on their race, ethnicity, or background.<br><br>
            "Born a Crime" is not only a compelling personal story but also a wide story on the human experience and the enduring quest for belonging and acceptance, themes that are as relevant in Kenya as they are in South Africa and also in other countries.
